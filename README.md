## Algo practice 2024

This time the approach is a bit different. After practicing the last time, I have identified patterns.
So this time we are going to do things a bit differently.


#### First, jog our memory

We are going to go through 100-150 curated list on leetcode. This is going to jog our memory fast.
While doing this, we are going to look through the solution.

The aim of this is to work on developing the ability to think of a declarative solution, rather than
how to code it.


#### Second, practice by topics

We are going to practice in groups.

- Arrays, searching, sorting, two pointer, left-right pointer, slow-fast pointers, stacks
- Recurssion, greedy and easily dp. This step again, we are going to develop the ability to think dp than code it.
- Matrix based approach to DP
- Trees and Graphs
